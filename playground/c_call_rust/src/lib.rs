// Add your Rust definitions for `pass_int`, `contains_rust`,
// `get_rust_string`, and `free_rust_string` to this file.
//
// The `contains_rust` function should return true if the input string
// contains the substring "rust" and false otherwise.
//
// You may handle Rust errors however you like. Panicking is okay.
// The focus of this activity is on FFI, not error handling best practices.
//
// I encourage you to try thinking about when to mark functions `unsafe`.
// Where applicable, try thinking about how you would write proper safety
// documentation for the function as well. When you feel satisfied, you can
// check `solution.rs` to see how I've done it. Feel free to disagree with how
// I write my docs. I just try to follow the std library's documentation style
// without being too verbose.
//
// I also encourage you to run Valgrind on your solution (via `./run.sh v`).
