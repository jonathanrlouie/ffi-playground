# Workshop Activity

## Calling C from Rust
For this exercise, we will be creating Rust bindings for a C library.

Navigate to the `playground/rust_call_c` folder. In the `src` directory of this folder are 4 files: `hello_world.h`, `hello_world.c`, `main.rs`, and `solution.rs`.

Open `main.rs` and add the missing extern block(s) and type definition(s) corresponding to `hello_world.h`, as instructed. You should not need to modify the `main` function at all. You can run the program using `cargo run`. When you feel satisfied with your solution, you may read `solution.rs` to check your answer.
